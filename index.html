									My first project was to create a CV. It wasn't responsive and
									had a few shortcomings, but I'm proud of myself, that I made
									it. When i Was creating this project, I used grid, flexbox and
									terminal. The entire project was published on Github Pages.
									Later I decided to transfer it for another hosting domain and
									to create new CV which is responsive.

									I am currently working in a cafe. I was a manager there for
									almost a year. I belive that thanks to this I have a high
									level of communication with people. I also have a high level
									of preparation a delicious coffee. I learned many other skills
									in this place such as the fact that the most important thing
									in working with clients is to understand the client's needs.
									If we care about them, they will come back.
									<!-- At the moment i want to focus on learning programming.  !-->
